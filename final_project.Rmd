## Introduction

- **Auto thefts Data** from Toronto Police Service

- **Goal:** reduce the number of Auto Thefts

- **Focus** on the location and time

- Statistical inferences: Histograms, box plots, bar plots

- Chi-Squared tests, hypothesis tesing


## Objectives 

To answer the following questions:

- Do some **areas** have a higher incidence of auto thefts?

- Are most auto thefts carried out at a specific **time** of day?

- Do the **area** & the **time** of incident occurred independent of each other?


## Data Summary 
New Variables:

<font size="5">- **day_night** - Groups the hours of the day: Day 06:00-18:00 & Night 18:00-06:00. </font> 

<font size="5">- **daytime** - Groups the hours of the day: Morning 06:00-12:00, afternoon 12:00-18:00, evening 18:00-00:00, late night 00:00-06:00.</font>

<font size="5">- **Area** - Groups Hood ID into districts: East York, Etobicoke, North York, Old Toronto, Scarborough and York. </font>

<font size="5">- **crime_rate** - Crime rate for a specific area in 2016.</font>

## Data Summary (cont'd)
New Data Frames:

- **new_auto_thefts** - created from *auto_thefts* with variables related to the time and location, included year 2014-2018.
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
glimpse(new_auto_thefts)
```


## Statistical Methods
- **Hypothesis test** Relationship between auto thefts occur in day and night

- **Chi squared test** Independence between the occurrence time and location & Independence between occurrence time and premise type.

- **Bootstrap sampling** Confidence interval of proportion of auto thefts occur in day time

## Results
### Frequency versus years (2014-2018)
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
new_auto_thefts %>% ggplot(aes(x = occurrenceyear)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black", fill = "gray") + labs(title = "Frequency versus occurrence year", x = "Occurrence year of the crime" , y = "Total frequency from 2014 to 2018")
```

<font size="5">- Auto thefts remained fairly constant from 2014 - 2017, with an increase in 2018.</font>

## Frenquency versus months
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
new_auto_thefts %>% ggplot(aes(x = occurrencemonth)) + geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "gray") + labs(title = "Frequency versus occurrence month", x = "Occurrence month of the crime" , y = "Total frequency from 2014 to 2018")

```

<font size="5">- No obvious trends between occurrence month and number of auto thefts crimes.</font>

<font size="5">- The months with the least auto theft crimes are January and February. </font>
 
## Frenquency versus day of week
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
new_auto_thefts %>% ggplot(aes(x = occurrencedayofweek)) + geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "gray") + labs(title = "Frequency versus occurrence day of week", x = "Occurrence day of week of the crime" , y = "Total frequency from 2014 to 2018")
```

<font size="5">-The number of auto theft crimes remains fairly consistent thoughout the week.</font>

##  Frequency versus occurrence hour
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
new_auto_thefts %>% ggplot(aes(x = occurrencehour)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black", fill = "gray") + labs(title = "Frequency versus occurrence hour", x = "Occurrence hour of the crime" , y = "Total frequency from 2014 to 2018")
```
<font size="5">- The frequency of auto thefts begins to steadily increase after 16 o'clock.</font>

<font size="5">- There is a mode around 23 which corresponds to 11 oâ€™clock in the evening.</font> 

## Frequency versus occurrence hour (2014 to 2018)
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
new_auto_thefts %>% ggplot(aes(x=occurrencehour)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color="black", fill="gray") + labs(title = "Frequency versus occurrence hour", x = "Occurrence hour of the crime" , y = "Total frequency")  + facet_wrap(~occurrenceyear)
```

<font size="5">- The occurrence hour of auto theft crimes tends to remains fairly consistent throughout the years. </font>

## Summary table (proportion of auto thefts in day and night) 
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=6}
dayandnight <- new_auto_thefts %>% select(Index_, occurrencehour) %>% mutate(daytime = ifelse(occurrencehour >= 6 & occurrencehour < 18, "Day", "Night")) 
dayandnight %>% group_by(daytime) %>% summarize(n=n(), Proportion = n/18130)

```

## Hypothesis test
<font size="5"> $H_{0}$ = 0.5 (assume that the proportion that auto thefts happen in day time is 0.5)</font>
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
auto<-auto_thefts %>% select(Index_, occurrenceyear, occurrencemonth, occurrenceday, occurrencedayofyear, occurrencedayofweek, occurrencehour)%>% mutate(day_night=ifelse(occurrencehour>=6 &occurrencehour<18,"day", "night"))

```

## Conclusion

- Certain areas have a higher incidence of auto thefts which is shown by the varying crime rates.

- Most auto thefts tend to be carried out at night, more specifically between evening and late night. This was confirmed by bootstrap testing and hypothesis testing.

- There is strong evidence to suggest the time of day of the incident and the location of the incident are interdependent.


## Recommendations

- The Toronto Police Service should send more patrols to areas with a higher crime rate.

- Officers should be put on patrol at night because that is when more auto thefts tend to be carried out.


## Limitations

- As the seasons change the sun sets at different times and this may have an impact on auto thefts.

- The location data had to be generalised and this resulted in large variations in the size of areas, which affected our analysis.

- The type of car stolen was not given. Newer cars have are built differently and could possibly be easier to break into.
